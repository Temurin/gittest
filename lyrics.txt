this was a triumph!
i'm making a note here - huge success!
it's hard to overstate my satisfaction

aperture science
we do what we must
because we can
for the good of all of us
except the ones who are dead

now there's no use crying over every mistake
you just keep on trying til you run out of cake

and the science gets done
and you make a neat gun
for the people who are still alive
