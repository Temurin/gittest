this was a triumph!
i'm making a note here - huge success!
it's hard to overstate my satisfaction

aperture science
we do what we must
because we can
for the good of all of us
except the ones who are dead

now there's no use crying over every mistake
you just keep on trying til you run out of cake

and the science gets done
and you make a neat gun
for the people who are still alive

i'm not even angry
i'm being so sincere right now
even though you broke my heart and killed me
and tore me to pieces
and threw every piece into a fire
as they burned it hurt because
i was so happy for you

now these points of data make a beautiful line
and we're out of beta we're releasing on time
so i'm GlaD i got burned
think of all the things we learned
from the people who are still alive

go ahead and leave me
i think i prefer to stay inside
maybe you'll find someone else to help you
maybe Black Mesa
that was A JOKE  HAHA  fat chance
anyway this cake is great
it's so delicious and moist

look at me still talking when there's science to do
when i look out there it makes me GlaD i'm not you
i've got research to be done
and experiments to run
on the people who are still alive

and believe me i am still alive

i'm doing science and i'm still alive

i feel fantastic and i'm still alive

and when you're dying i'll be still alive

and when you're dead i will be still alive

still alive

still alive

time for whatever lyrics come on pandora

don't think cuz i understand
i care
don't think cuz i'm talking
we're friends

i wanna hold your hand inside you  ?   !?  ..
i wanna take the breath that's true
i look to you and i seen nothing
i look to you to see the truth

fade into you
strange you .. never .. me
fade into you
i think it's straaann eeeehvee

one of these mornings
it won't be very long
you will look for me
and i'll be gone
oh wait that's moby and whoah that was the whole song

come with me
stop making it so hard
you can't _ while you are _ing
nothing's changed
just gotta recognize that
it's a game of living and dying
it's amazing
